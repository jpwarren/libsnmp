	* Fixed bug in snmpmanager relating to the order in which
	messages are sent and received.

2005-04-25  Jim Crumpler  <jgc@slug.jgc.unicity.com.au>

	* lib/libsnmp/rfc1155.py (asnTagNumbers): added toObjectID()
	function to Asn1Objects (for encoding as an index)
	* Fixed problems with __init__ stealing a reference to passed
	object.

2004-12-21  Jim Crumpler  <jgc@slug.jgc.unicity.com.au>

	* lib/libsnmp/rfc1155.py (ObjectID.__getitem__): supported

	* Added licensing information to release under LGPL.

2003-09-19  Jim Crumpler  <jgc@pringle.jgc.unicity.com.au>

	* lib/libsnmp/rfc1155.py (OctetString.decodeContents): changed all
	decodeContents() methods to set the local value of the object and
	to return self.  This saves alot of object creations, however we
	need to make sure we don't use an object as a factory and expect
	its value to not change.

2003-09-18  Jim Crumpler  <jgc@pringle.jgc.unicity.com.au>

	* lib/libsnmp/rfc1155.py (Asn1Object.decode): move the tag and
	length portions of decode() to decodeTag() and decodeLength()

0.0.1     2003-08-13  Justin Warren <justin.warren@unicity.com.au>

        * First version of libsnmp added to CVS
